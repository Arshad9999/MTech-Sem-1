## Learning notes

### 1. Foundations and language of research

**Syllabus topics:** Meaning, objectives, motivation, and utility, Theory and empiricism, Deductive and inductive theory, Scientific method, Concept, construct, definition, and variable, Research process

Research is systematic inquiry designed to produce defensible knowledge. Deduction tests consequences derived from theory; induction develops patterns or theory from observations. Concepts become measurable through explicit operational definitions and variables.

**Key equation or relation:** `question -> design -> evidence -> analysis -> interpretation -> communication`

**Worked example:** The construct 'system usability' is not directly observed; a study must define indicators, instruments, and scoring before collecting evidence.

**Must understand:** Write one conceptual definition and one operational definition for every key construct.

### 2. Problem identification and hypotheses

**Syllabus topics:** Research question, Investigation question, Measurement issues, Hypothesis, Good hypothesis qualities, Null and alternative hypothesis, Testing logic and importance

A research problem identifies a knowledge gap; a research question makes it answerable. A hypothesis states a testable expectation. The null provides a reference model, while the alternative represents the competing claim.

**Key equation or relation:** `H0: parameter = reference; H1: parameter differs or follows a stated direction`

**Worked example:** Question: Does interface A reduce task time compared with B? H0 states no difference in the population; H1 states a difference. The design must define users, tasks, timing, and exclusions.

**Must understand:** A useful hypothesis is specific, measurable, falsifiable, and connected to theory.

### 3. Research design

**Syllabus topics:** Concept and importance, Features of a good design, Exploratory design, Descriptive design, Experimental design, Independent and dependent variables

Research design is the plan connecting questions to evidence and inference. Exploratory designs clarify poorly understood problems; descriptive designs characterize populations or phenomena; experiments manipulate an independent variable and observe outcomes under controlled comparison.

**Key equation or relation:** `observed effect = treatment effect + bias + random variation`

**Worked example:** A randomized experiment estimates the effect of a new interface on completion time. A descriptive survey can estimate current adoption but alone cannot establish the same causal claim.

**Must understand:** Align question, sampling, measurement, comparison, analysis, and validity threats.

### 4. Qualitative and quantitative approaches

**Syllabus topics:** Qualitative research, Quantitative research, Measurement, Causality, Generalization, Replication, Merging approaches

Qualitative research investigates meaning and context through rich evidence; quantitative research analyzes measured variables numerically. Mixed approaches integrate them when neither alone answers the full question.

**Key equation or relation:** `triangulation compares evidence from multiple methods or sources`

**Worked example:** Interviews can reveal why users abandon a tool, while logs estimate how often and at which step. Integration connects themes with observed behavioral patterns.

**Must understand:** Choose methods because they answer the question, not because one label sounds more rigorous.

### 5. Measurement quality and levels

**Syllabus topics:** What is measured, Measurement problems, Validity, Reliability, Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, Ratio

Validity concerns whether an inference or instrument measures what it claims. Reliability concerns consistency. Nominal values are categories, ordinal values have order, interval scales have equal differences, and ratio scales also have a meaningful zero.

**Key equation or relation:** `observed score = true component + measurement error`

**Worked example:** A 1-to-5 satisfaction item is ordered, but equal spacing between responses is an assumption. Repeating an unreliable instrument cannot repair poor construct validity.

**Must understand:** Name the scale level before choosing summaries or statistical tests.

### 6. Sampling

**Syllabus topics:** Population, sample, frame, error, size, and non-response, Good sample characteristics, Simple random, Systematic, Stratified random, Multi-stage sampling, Sample-size determination, Practical considerations

A target population is the group of interest; the sampling frame is the operational list used to select units. Probability sampling gives known selection mechanisms. Sample size depends on precision, variability, design, analysis, and practical constraints.

**Key equation or relation:** `SE of a mean decreases approximately as 1/sqrt(n)`

**Worked example:** Stratified sampling can ensure representation from small but important groups. Increasing sample size does not remove coverage bias or systematic non-response.

**Must understand:** Document target population, frame coverage, selection method, response, and exclusions.

### 7. Data preparation and analysis

**Syllabus topics:** Data preparation, Univariate analysis, Frequency tables, Bar and pie charts, Percentages, Bivariate cross-tabulation, Chi-square association test

Data preparation applies a documented codebook, type checks, missing-value rules, and quality checks. Univariate analysis summarizes one variable. Cross-tabulation and the chi-square test assess association between categorical variables under appropriate assumptions.

**Key equation or relation:** `chi-square = sum((observed-expected)^2/expected)`

**Worked example:** For device type by completion status, compute expected counts from row and column totals, inspect whether counts are adequate, calculate chi-square, and report effect context rather than only significance.

**Must understand:** Preserve raw data, make transformations reproducible, and distinguish missing from zero.

### 8. Interpretation and paper writing

**Syllabus topics:** Interpretation of data, Research paper layout, Computer science journals, Journal impact factor, When and where to publish, Publishing ethics, Plagiarism and self-plagiarism

Interpretation connects results to the research question, assumptions, uncertainty, limitations, and prior work. A paper typically communicates problem, related context, methods, results, discussion, and references. Venue selection should consider scope, audience, review quality, policies, and fit rather than a metric alone.

**Key equation or relation:** `claim strength must not exceed design and evidence strength`

**Worked example:** An observational association should not be written as a causal effect. Reusing substantial prior text or results without transparent citation can be self-plagiarism.

**Must understand:** Audit every claim for evidence, uncertainty, attribution, and reproducibility.

### 9. Research sources and databases

**Syllabus topics:** Encyclopedias, Research guides, Handbooks, Academic databases for computer science

Reference works orient a topic and supply terminology; research databases help discover primary literature. Search should combine concepts, synonyms, Boolean operators, filters, citation chaining, and a documented inclusion process.

**Key equation or relation:** `search concept blocks: (termA OR synonym) AND (termB OR synonym)`

**Worked example:** Begin with a broad scoping search, refine keywords from relevant papers, then trace references backward and citations forward while recording queries and dates.

**Must understand:** A reproducible search records database, exact query, date, filters, and screening criteria.

### 10. Research tools and techniques

**Syllabus topics:** Effective information search, Zotero and Mendeley, LaTeX and MS Office, Plagiarism-detection software

Reference managers store metadata and attachments and generate citations, but records still require verification. Document tools support structured writing and revision. Similarity tools flag overlap for human review; they do not determine plagiarism by themselves.

**Key equation or relation:** `tool output + researcher judgment + transparent process = defensible workflow`

**Worked example:** Import a DOI into a reference manager, verify author and venue metadata, attach the lawful full text, tag the study, cite it through the chosen style, and check the final bibliography.

**Must understand:** Back up the library, verify metadata, preserve notes, and never treat a similarity score as a verdict.
